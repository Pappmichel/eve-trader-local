"""Hand-curated business constants for the Doctrine tool - same spirit as
production/constants.py's own docstring: small, curated values, not SDE
data (SDE-derived slot classification itself lives in storage.get_type_slot/
sde_type_slots, populated by production/sde.py's refresh_sde - this module
only names the *labels* that data uses, not the effect-ID -> slot mapping
CSV-parsing detail, which stays local to production/sde.py).

Deliberately no imports from eve_trader.production - the two packages'
constants (e.g. SHIP_CATEGORY_ID) happen to share a value but are kept as
separate, small, independently-duplicated constants rather than a
cross-package import, avoiding a doctrine<->production dependency edge that
doesn't otherwise need to exist (doctrine's only real dependency on
Production is storage.py's own character_assets/corp_assets tables, read
directly - see engine.py, not the production package itself).

# names); "drone"/"cargo"/"charge" have no SDE slot effect at all and are
# classified by SDE *category* instead (see doctrine/parser.py).
#
# "fuelbay"/"shipmaintenancebay" (GitHub issue #18) are a deliberate
# addition on top of the original nine: a capital ship's Fuel Bay and Ship
# Maintenance Bay contents have no representation in standard EFT export
# text at all (CCP's Fitting Formats spec only covers slots/drones/cargo),
# so they're entered separately (doctrine/parser.py's parse_bay_items, wired
# up in EftFittingForm.tsx as two extra plain-text lists next to the EFT
# paste) rather than through the main grammar above. Fleet Hangar contents
# are deliberately NOT a separate section - confirmed with the user
# (2026-08-20): they read as ordinary Cargo Hold in a contract paste anyway,
# so bucketing them with "cargo" is already correct, nothing to add.

# visible with a clear "Expired" marker (Contracts.tsx) rather than
# silently vanishing from the next full-replace snapshot with no trace at
