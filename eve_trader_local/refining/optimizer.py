"""Multi-ore buy-vs-refine optimization for the Mineral Shopping List -
ported from `eve_trader/refining/optimizer.py` (parent repo, GitHub issue
#93).

Answers "what's the cheapest way to end up holding *these* minerals": buy
them outright, buy-and-refine compressed ore/ice, or (usually) a mix -
optimized across EVERY available ore/ice type at once, not one "best ore"
per mineral. This has to be a real linear program rather than a greedy
ISK-per-desired-mineral ranking: a greedy pick is only optimal when one
ore's mineral ratio happens to line up with the requested mix, and it
systematically over-buys whenever the cheapest source of mineral A drags in
far more of mineral B than needed (exactly the situation a mixed
Tritanium/Pyerite/Mexallon build list creates).

    minimize    sum_i  ore_portions_i x landed_cost_per_portion_i
              + sum_j  direct_buy_j   x mineral_landed_cost_j
    subject to  sum_i  ore_portions_i x yield_ij  +  direct_buy_j  >=  required_j
                for every required mineral j
                ore_portions_i >= 0,  direct_buy_j >= 0

`>=`, not `==`: over-delivering a mineral is allowed (and unavoidable - an
ore refines into a fixed ratio), under-delivering is the one thing a
shopping list must never do.

Solved with scipy.optimize.linprog (HiGHS). This is the only module in this
repo that needs scipy/numpy - a deliberate exception to the repo's
otherwise `requests`+`PyYAML`-only dependency list, since hand-rolling a
simplex implementation is exactly the kind of thing that's notoriously easy
to get subtly wrong (see SYNC.md).

Three modelling decisions worth knowing, all deliberate (carried over from
the parent unchanged):

1. **Portion-size (and direct-mineral) quantities are solved as real
   integers, via `linprog`'s `integrality` parameter - not relaxed to a
   continuous LP and rounded.** Reprocessing is genuinely discrete (you
   refine whole portions - 100 Veldspar at a time - and each material's
   output is floored, see reprocessing.py), which makes this properly a
   mixed-integer program. An earlier version of this file relaxed it to a
   continuous LP and rounded the result UP to the next whole portion, then
   ran a post-hoc heuristic that only ever *dropped* portions from the ore
   set the continuous relaxation had already given non-zero weight - it
   could never *add* an ore the relaxation left at exactly zero, even when
   one whole portion of that ore was the true cheapest way to cover a small
   requirement (a different ore only looked marginally cheaper
   *fractionally*, a margin whole-portion buying can't use). Confirmed via
   randomised brute-force comparison before the fix: ~8% of small synthetic
   cases landed more than 0.1% above the true discrete optimum, worst case
   observed 64% over. Every plan produced (before and after this fix) was
   still *feasible* - no requirement was ever left under-covered - this was
   purely a cost-optimality gap.

   Direct-mineral purchase quantities are ALSO marked integer, not left
   continuous - real minerals are bought in whole units too, and leaving
   that variable continuous re-opens a smaller version of the same gap: the
   solver would price a fractional "0.5 units direct" at half a unit's ISK,
   while the actual purchase (rounded up to a whole unit) costs a full unit
   - enough of a mismatch, on small requirements, to make the solver choose
   ore portions that are optimal for its own (wrong) continuous accounting
   but not for the real whole-unit cost. Marking both variable groups
   integer makes the solver's objective exactly the real cost, closing that
   gap too.

   The LP's own continuous relaxation (both variable groups left
   continuous) is still solved once, purely to report `ShoppingListPlan.
   lp_cost` as a "theoretical floor" next to the real (whole-unit) total -
   it plays no part in building the actual plan anymore. Fixed here by
   porting the parent's commit `90c669b` (`eve_trader/refining/
   optimizer.py`), which fixed this same bug there first.

2. **The structure's refining tax is modelled as reduced output, not an ISK
   fee.** EVE takes a structure's reprocessing tax out of the refined
   materials themselves, so for a *quantity* question ("do I end up with
   enough Tritanium?") the honest model is a smaller yield_ij - which is
   what the caller passes in. This differs from the Ore Shortlist's own
   treatment (pricing.py charges it as ISK against the sale proceeds); both
   are the same economics, but there the output is sold immediately and
   here it has to physically cover a build list.

3. **Surplus minerals get no credit.** An ore bought for its Mexallon also
   yields Tritanium the build list may not need; that leftover is reported
   (`MineralCoverage.surplus`) but is not valued in the objective.
   Crediting it would mean assuming it gets sold, which turns a shopping
   list into a trading decision - the Ore Shortlist is the tool for that.

Port note: the parent raises its own `OptimizationError`, which its actions
layer converts to `ActionError`. Here it raises `ActionError` directly -
this repo keeps that type in `errors.py` precisely so any module can raise
it without an import cycle, so the extra hop earns nothing.
