"""Multi-ore buy-vs-refine optimization for the Mineral Shopping List -
ported from `eve_trader/refining/optimizer.py` (parent repo, GitHub issue
#93).

Answers "what's the cheapest way to end up holding *these* minerals": buy
them outright, buy-and-refine compressed ore/ice, or (usually) a mix -
optimized across EVERY available ore/ice type at once, not one "best ore"
per mineral. This has to be a real linear program rather than a greedy
ISK-per-desired-mineral ranking: a greedy pick is only optimal when one
ore's mineral ratio happens to line up with the requested mix, and it
systematically over-buys whenever the cheapest source of mineral A drags in
far more of mineral B than needed (exactly the situation a mixed
Tritanium/Pyerite/Mexallon build list creates).

    minimize    sum_i  ore_portions_i x landed_cost_per_portion_i
              + sum_j  direct_buy_j   x mineral_landed_cost_j
    subject to  sum_i  ore_portions_i x yield_ij  +  direct_buy_j  >=  required_j
                for every required mineral j
                ore_portions_i >= 0,  direct_buy_j >= 0

`>=`, not `==`: over-delivering a mineral is allowed (and unavoidable - an
ore refines into a fixed ratio), under-delivering is the one thing a
shopping list must never do.

Solved with scipy.optimize.linprog (HiGHS). This is the only module in this
repo that needs scipy/numpy - a deliberate exception to the repo's
otherwise `requests`+`PyYAML`-only dependency list, since hand-rolling a
simplex implementation is exactly the kind of thing that's notoriously easy
to get subtly wrong (see SYNC.md).

Three modelling decisions worth knowing, all deliberate (carried over from
the parent unchanged):

1. **Portion-size rounding is handled outside the LP, by rounding UP.**
   Reprocessing is genuinely discrete (you refine whole portions - 100
   Veldspar at a time - and each material's output is floored, see
   reprocessing.py), which would make this an integer program. It's relaxed
   to a continuous LP instead - a fractional portion is a reasonable
   idealization while *searching* for the cheapest mix - and each ore's
   solved quantity is then rounded UP to the next whole portion in the plan
   the user actually buys from. Up, never down: rounding down would
   under-deliver against the stated requirement. Because per-material
   output is floored (not just scaled), rounding up isn't *by itself* proof
   the requirement still clears, so the rounded plan is re-verified against
   the real discrete yields and topped up until it does (see
   `_repair_shortfalls`) - `ShoppingListPlan.coverage` carries that proof
   per mineral. Rounding up can also *over*-buy (a requirement worth a
   fiftieth of a portion still costs a whole one), so a cheap
   single-portion descent on the real cost function then drops any portion
   that direct-buying replaces more cheaply (`_trim_rounded_plan`). The
   LP's own continuous optimum is kept as `ShoppingListPlan.lp_cost` so the
   (small) cost of rounding is visible rather than hidden.

2. **The structure's refining tax is modelled as reduced output, not an ISK
   fee.** EVE takes a structure's reprocessing tax out of the refined
   materials themselves, so for a *quantity* question ("do I end up with
   enough Tritanium?") the honest model is a smaller yield_ij - which is
   what the caller passes in. This differs from the Ore Shortlist's own
   treatment (pricing.py charges it as ISK against the sale proceeds); both
   are the same economics, but there the output is sold immediately and
   here it has to physically cover a build list.

3. **Surplus minerals get no credit.** An ore bought for its Mexallon also
   yields Tritanium the build list may not need; that leftover is reported
   (`MineralCoverage.surplus`) but is not valued in the objective.
   Crediting it would mean assuming it gets sold, which turns a shopping
   list into a trading decision - the Ore Shortlist is the tool for that.

**Known limitation (found while porting, present in the parent too - flagged,
deliberately not "fixed" here so the two repos stay behaviourally identical):**
the round-up-then-trim treatment of decision 1 only ever *descends* from the
ore set the continuous LP actually put weight on. It never tries an ore the LP
left at zero, so when the requirement is small relative to a portion's yield,
the true whole-portion optimum can use an ore the relaxation ignored and this
plan can come out materially more expensive than it (randomised search against
a brute-force whole-portion enumeration: ~8% of small random cases more than
0.1% over, ~3% more than 5% over, worst seen ~64% over). Every plan is still
*feasible* - nothing is ever under-covered - so this is an optimality gap, not
a wrong answer. Fixing it properly means solving the real integer program
(linprog's HiGHS supports `integrality=`), which is a change to make in the
parent first.

Port note: the parent raises its own `OptimizationError`, which its actions
layer converts to `ActionError`. Here it raises `ActionError` directly -
this repo keeps that type in `errors.py` precisely so any module can raise
it without an import cycle, so the extra hop earns nothing.
