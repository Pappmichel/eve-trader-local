"""Hand-curated reprocessing constants - GitHub issue #90 ("Ore & Minerals").

Two structurally different formulas, confirmed against real in-game values
during planning (2026-08-22), not an oversight that they diverge so much:

**Ore/ice path** (compressed ore/ice only, see refining/reprocessing.py
ore_ice_yield - the parent repo's own equivalent math lives in its
refining/engine.py instead; this repo folds it into reprocessing.py since
no separate engine.py exists here yet, see SYNC.md) - the real Upwell
structure reprocessing formula, confirmed
live against wiki.eveuniversity.org/Reprocessing (2026-08-23):
    Yield = (50 + Rig points) x (1 + Security modifier) x (1 + Structure modifier)
                               x (1 + Reprocessing skill)
                               x (1 + Reprocessing Efficiency skill)
                               x (1 + ore-or-ice-family skill)
                               x (1 + implant)
Confirmed maximum: 90.6% (Tatara, T2-Rig, null-sec, max skills, RX-804) -
(50+3) x 1.12 x 1.055 x 1.15 x 1.10 x 1.10 x 1.04 = 90.63%.

An earlier version of this file approximated the structure/rig/security
component as a single back-solved "Base(structure, rig, security)" additive
term instead - a guess made without live access to the real wiki formula at
the time (confirmed only against the single 90.6%-ceiling data point, not
the underlying formula shape), off by ~0.1-0.2pp even at that one confirmed
point and not exactly right anywhere else in the structure/rig/security
space. See STRUCTURE_YIELD_MODIFIER/RIG_YIELD_BONUS_POINTS/
security_yield_modifier below for the real formula's own components.

**Scrapmetal path** (everything else - modules/ammo/drones/loot, see
refining/reprocessing.py scrapmetal_yield) - structure/rig/security/implant/the
general Reprocessing and Reprocessing Efficiency skills have NO effect here,
a genuine asymmetry vs. the ore/ice path, not a bug:
    Yield = 50% (fixed) + Scrapmetal Processing skill
Confirmed maximum: 55%.

Re-verify against wiki.eveuniversity.org/Reprocessing if CCP ever rebalances
these (structure/rig reprocessing bonuses have been tuned before, e.g. the
Tatara's own structure modifier moved 4% -> 5.5% at one point per patch
notes - the game's live values are the source of truth, this file is a
snapshot of them).
