"""Pure reprocessing-yield math - GitHub issue #90 ("Ore & Minerals").

**File-mapping note**: this module ports the parent repo's
`refining/engine.py` (its actual ore/ice + scrapmetal yield formulas), not
its `refining/reprocessing.py` (which is the *Reprocessing-tab quote
calculation*, issue #92 - it wraps this same math with live ESI/Goonmetrics
pricing, TradingConfig's structure_sell_haircut and a buy-vs-sell
recommendation, none of which is ported yet - see SYNC.md). The two parent
files share a name collision only in spirit ("reprocessing"); this repo picks
the name for what's actually ported here rather than mirroring the parent's
file split one-for-one at a stage where the other half doesn't exist yet.

Two structurally different yield-% formulas (ore_ice_yield/scrapmetal_yield -
see constants.py's module docstring for the full derivation/confirmed
maximums), sharing one material-application step (apply_reprocessing_yield) -
both are "type -> material yield" lookups against the same SDE
sde_type_materials table (storage.get_type_materials).
