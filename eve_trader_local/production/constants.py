"""Hand-curated Production business constants - small, curated multipliers
(not SDE data).

Ported near-verbatim from the parent repo's `eve_trader/production/
constants.py`. Everything here is a fixed table of real EVE game values, so
it is pure sync-candidate material: when CCP changes a structure bonus or a
decryptor stat, both repos change identically.

ME/TE is modeled in three independently-stacking layers (all multiplicative,
matching how EVE actually combines them):

1. ACTIVITY_MODS - the blueprint/BPC's *own* research level, activity-specific:
   - Tech I: the entry here (0.90/0.80, i.e. "assumes perfect ME/TE" -> BPO
     researched to ME10/TE20, the real EVE research caps) is only the
     *fallback* baseline used when you don't own that specific BPO (or
     haven't ESI-synced it) - the buy-vs-build engine prefers your actual
     owned BPO's real ME/TE when available. Deliberately a pure research-level
     multiplier with no structure/rig bonus baked in, since STRUCTURE_TYPES/
     RIG_TIERS below are applied separately on top - baking a bonus in here
     too would double-count it.
   - Tech II *and* Tech III: both resolved per item from their BPC's
     decryptor - Tech III uses the exact same activity_id=8 Invention as Tech
     II (CCP removed the old relic-based "Reverse Engineering" mechanic years
     ago, confirmed against real SDE data), so classify_activity() routes both
     through this same "Tech II" label whenever an item is genuinely invented
     (i.e. a real invention recipe exists - metaLevel is never consulted, see
     classify_activity's docstring). The entry here is only the shared
     fallback baseline (a "None"-decryptor BPC: ME2/TE4, i.e. 0.98/0.96) used
     when neither an invention recipe nor a manually-selected decryptor is
     found for an item.
   - Reaction: reaction formulas have no ME/TE research in EVE - base 1.0/1.0,
     all reduction comes from STRUCTURE_TYPES/RIG_TIERS instead.
   - Faction: confirmed with the user (2026-07-16) - Faction blueprints are
     always ME0/TE0 in real EVE and cannot be researched or changed at all
     (unlike Tech I, which can be researched up to ME10/TE20), so unlike
     Tech I, this is *not* a fallback "assumes perfect research" baseline -
     it's the one and only value a Faction BPO can ever have, no owned-BPO
     lookup needed or performed.
2. STRUCTURE_TYPES - the base bonus of the structure you build in.
3. RIG_TIERS - the *additional* bonus from whichever rig tier is installed.

job_cost_rate is untouched by any of this - it's a system-cost-index/structure-
tax question, unrelated to ME/TE.
