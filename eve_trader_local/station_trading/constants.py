"""Static EVE-mechanic tables for the Station Trading tool - real skill
type_ids and the order-slot-count formula, not heuristics (see CLAUDE.md's
"Real SDE data drives classification" section).

Confirmed directly against the parent repo's live sde_types cache
(2026-08-27), not trusted from memory or the initial web research alone -
that research also named a "Margin Trading" skill (buy-order escrow
reduction), which does not exist anywhere in the SDE's full "Trade Skills"
group (26 real members checked) and has evidently been removed from the game
at some point - dropped entirely here, along with any escrow-reduction
modeling. Several of the remaining IDs also differ from what memory alone
would have guessed (e.g. Tycoon is 18580, not 16598 - that's actually
Marketing).

No real overlap with production/constants.py's job_slots_from_skills: that
one derives manufacturing/reaction job slots from an entirely different set
of industry skills (Mass Production, Advanced Mass Production, ...) - a
different game mechanic on a different skill tree, not a duplicate of this
one.
